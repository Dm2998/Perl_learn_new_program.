I think that when you learn something complicated later it is easier to start another programming language

# Type Numeric	String
The basic arithmetic operators in Perl are: +, -, *, /, %, and **.
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and they return a boolean value. Perl provides several comparison operators that you can use to compare values. Comparison operators can be used for numeric and string values. 
These operators are: >, <, ==, !=, <=, >= for numeric values, 
                and gt, lt, eq, ne, le, ge for string values.
                
- [Greater Than: >	gt](#Greater-Than:->-gt)
- [Less Than: >	gt](#Less-Than:-<-lt)
- [Not Equal: == eq](#Not-Equeal:-==eq)
- [Not-Equel: != ne](#Not-Equeal:-!=-ne)
- [Less than or equal to: <= le](#Less-than-or-equal-to:-<=-le)
- [Greater than or equal to:	>=	ge](#Greater-than-or-equal-to:->=-ge)
